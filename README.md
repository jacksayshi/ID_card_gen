# ID_card_gen
# #Creating a pdf file with multiple pages with a ID card template for employees (Details in CSV)

<p>In Line, df = pd.read_csv('employee_data.csv') </br> Replace the csv file name with your csv file and in jupyter notebook upload the csv file in homepage.</br></br>
Replace template path with the path of ID card template in your system.</br></br>
CSV header names should be properly corresponded in the code </br>("Name", "Photo Location " Correspond to name of employee and location of photo of employee in local system)</br></br>
In csv do not place photo location in quotes.</br>  </br>
Font path should also be replaced. (In windows different fonts can be found in C//Windows. </br>( For mac : /System/Library/Fonts/  )</br></br>
Coordinates corresponding to name placing and photo placing can be modified. But they are neatly placed. </br></br>
PDF files save path can be modified at pdf.output() at the end of the code.</p>
